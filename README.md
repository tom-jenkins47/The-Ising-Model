## The Ising Model ##

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model:

The Ising model (or Lenz–Ising model), named after the physicists Ernst Ising and Wilhelm Lenz, is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The model consists of discrete variables that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic "spins" that can be in one of two states (+1 or −1). The spins are arranged in a graph, usually a lattice (where the local structure repeats periodically in all directions), allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. Neighboring spins that agree have a lower energy than those that disagree; the system tends to the lowest energy but heat disturbs this tendency, thus creating the possibility of different structural phases. The model allows the identification of phase transitions as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is one of the simplest statistical models to show a phase transition.

#### Run Main.py to display an animation of the Ising model on a defined grid size. The code can also be modified to collect data if desired by uncommenting the relevant lines in the main function. To collect data on the evolution of the system with varying temperature; run MainTempAnalysis.py. If using the Spyder IDE, ensure the plotting backend is set to automatic. ####
